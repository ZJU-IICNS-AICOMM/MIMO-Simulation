# MIMO-Simulation
Simulation of digital Communication with MIMO in Python.

This includes classes related to digital modulation (M-QAM, M-PSK, etc), AWGN channel, Rayleigh and MIMO channel models, including Rayleigh and mmWave etc.. It is implemented for easily creating physical layer simulations.

Moreover, we will also impelment some other key techniques in MIMO communications, such as channel feedback, estimation, MRC, and Alamouti. 


## TODO
- [x] implement a basic SISO digital communication systems with digital modulations over digital channel models.
- [x] implement a MIMO communication systems over SVD MIMO schemes.
- [ ] implement the channel feedback. 
- [ ] implement the channel estimation.
- [ ] Other channel models, such as tapped delay line channel model.
- [ ] Other modulation schemes, such as OFDM.
- [ ] Other transmission schemes for MIMO, such as MRC and Alamouti etc..
